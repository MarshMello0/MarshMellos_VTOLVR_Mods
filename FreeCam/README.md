FreeCam adds some buttons to your desktop view which gives the ability to spawn another camera and fly around with your keyboard. This makes it possible to get different shots for screenshots, videos or can just be used when you want to explore the map.

### Controls

- W = Forward
- S = Backwards
- A = Left
- D = Right
- Spacebar = Up
- Left Control = Down
- Left Shift = Sprint
- P = Hide/Show Buttons
